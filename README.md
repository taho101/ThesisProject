	In order to run the code JDK~(Java Development Kit) and an IDE~(Integrated Development Environment) needs to be installed on the computer. JDK can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html. 
	
	In terms on an IDE we recommend the use of Eclipse or NetBeans. The latest version of NetBeans can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-142931.html. Since Eclipse has different distributions we recommend the usage of Eclipse Luna since this is the environment we used for development. The IDE can be downloaded from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/marsr. 
	
	In order to see the different results of the interpretation of different components the file path inside of the main execution file "Execution.java" located in package "com.java.main" needs to be changed.
